The user just need to provide a XML file to set basic configuration, and set the output directory for the generated


## Getting started

The code generator tool has a?[Protege Plugin](./codegenerator.protege.plugin/README.md)?to be used in Protege Ontology editor, a [Maven plugin](./codegenerator.maven.plugin/README.md), and a [REST service](./codegenerator.rest.plugin/README.md) to use as a set of web services.
Checkout any of those flavours for specific instuctions about how to use them.

For usage, read wiki.

```

## Testing

Is automatically performed for the instalation process. Check tests in the code (/src/test/java). Execute the test with
