# Code Generator Maven Plugin 
The Maven plugin is an adaptation of the [Code Generator](../README.md) to be used in the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) lifecycle. 
It consists of a single goal *generate*, which by default is executed during the *generate-sources* phase; meaning the results could be compiled right after.

## Getting started

add the following to your pom.xml:
```xml
...
<build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>es.upm.tfo.lst</groupId>
        <artifactId>codegenerator.maven.plugin</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>generate-code</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>generate</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
		<configuration>
			<xmlTemplate>file:///myTemplate/template.xml</xmlTemplate>
		</configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
...
```
**NOTE:** change the xmlTemplate value to the url referencing the template to use.

Code generation will occur on generate-sources phase, when installing.

## Installing

You'll need maven.

```
mvn clean install
```

## Testing

Is automatically performed for the instalation process. Check tests in the code (/src/test/java). Execute the test with 

```
